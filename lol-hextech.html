							<p>
								<span class="title">Hextech Annie</span><br>
								<span class="text">A scientific prodigy even among the intellectuals of the Hextech renaissance, Annie's beautiful, living warbears are among the most prized innovations of the era. Her most mysterious creation, Tibbers, is always close at hand—her confidant, friend, and monstrous bodyguard.</span>
							</p>

						<div class="image-inner__item image-inner--02">
							<img src="assets/images/lol/jarvan-10.png" alt="jarvan-hextech">
							<p>
								<span class="title">Hextech Jarvan IV</span><br>
								<span class="text">The Hextech Renaissance appealed not only to those with backgrounds in science, but also to those looking for an escape from their day-to-day lives. For the young Prince Jarvan, it presented the chance to enhance his martial skill—with technology that would have never been accepted within his father's kingdom.</span>

						</div>
						<div class="image-inner__item image-inner--03">
							<img src="assets/images/lol/kass-07.png" alt="kass-hextech">
							<p>
								<span class="title">Hextech Kassadin</span><br>
								<span class="text">Engrossed in his work to the point of near-obsession, Kassadin vanished for some time into the bowels of his labyrinthian workshop, disappearing from public life for years. When he emerged, he revealed a shocking hextech innovation to the world: his own body, fully integrated with the technology he so loved.</span>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="image-inner__item image-inner--04">
							<img src="assets/images/lol/malza-09.png" alt="malza-hextech">
							<p>
								<span class="title">Hextech Malzahar</span><br>
								<span class="text">Upon hearing that the origin of hextech lay in his homeland of Shurima, Malzahar ventured out into the wastes alone. There, after suffering a life-changing revelation, he became its greatest messenger, claiming to see prophecies of the coming of a second hextech renaissance.</span>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="image-inner__item image-inner--05">
							<img src="assets/images/lol/poppy-10.png" alt="poppy-hextech">
							<p>
								<span class="title">Hextech Poppy</span><br>
								<span class="text">Artificers of the Hextech renaissance owe much to Poppy, an expert engineer of the delicate craft. Having perfected the infusion of life into the inanimate, she now feverishly researches the ultimate scientific breakthrough - the creation of an artificial soul.</span>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="image-inner__item image-inner--06">
							<img src="assets/images/lol/seju-09.png" alt="seju-hextech">
							<p>
								<span class="title">Hextech Sejuani</span><br>
								<span class="text">A merchant tycoon hailing from the top echelons of Piltovan society, Sejuani paved the way for the manufacture of hextech mounts. Often seen atop the back of her trusted stead, Bristech, she surveys the gilded streets of her magnificent city, always on the lookout to recruit young innovators who dare to push the boundaries of science and engineering.</span>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="image-inner__item image-inner--07">
							<img src="assets/images/lol/swain-06.png" alt="swain-hextech">
							<p>
								<span class="title">Hextech Swain</span><br>
								<span class="text">The hextech artificer known as Jericho Swain is an almost legendary figure among Piltover's growing upper crust. Though he professes not to meddle in city affairs, he has been quietly integrating various hextech components into his own body… and with them, unparalleled access to the eyes and ears of thousands of artificial creatures.</span>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="image-inner__item image-inner--08">
							<img src="assets/images/lol/ziggs-08.png" alt="ziggs-hextech">
							<p>
								<span class="title">Hextech Ziggs</span><br>
								<span class="text">Famed inventor of Tocker, Ziggs is a savant to some, to others a maniac. All can agree that no matter the consequences, Ziggs seems to enjoy his experiments—especially the subsequent explosions. What is perhaps most miraculous of all is how he and Tocker have survived so many blasts over the years.</span>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="image-inner__item image-inner--09">
							<img src="assets/images/lol/alistar-10.png" alt="alistar-hextech">
							<p>
								<span class="title">Hextech Alistar</span><br>
								<span class="text">The fusion of arcane sorcery and Piltovan ingenuity, Alistar is an advanced, living golem built by the finest artificers in Runeterra. Tasked with guarding the secrets of hextech, it crushes all who would abuse the methods behind its creation.</span>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="image-inner__item image-inner--10">
							<img src="assets/images/lol/amumu-09.png" alt="amumu-hextech">
							<p>
								<span class="title">Hextech Amumu</span><br>
								<span class="text">A mechanical boy intended as a playmate for wealthy children, Amumu has been long forgotten in the advent of newer and more advanced Hextech innovations. But a child has feelings, and within his artificial mind something has begun to awaken that will change the history of Hextech forever.</span>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="image-inner__item image-inner--11">
							<img src="assets/images/lol/galio-07.png" alt="galio-hextech">
							<p>
								<span class="title">Hextech Galio</span><br>
								<span class="text">Sensing a shift in the marketability of Hextech items, several of Piltover's largest industrial families pooled resources to create Galio, a massive golem donated to the city and her people. While he is ostensibly a walking advertisement, the protective creature is both curious about the world, and proud of his responsibility.</span>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="image-inner__item image-inner--12">
							<img src="assets/images/lol/kogmaw-10.png" alt="kogmaw-hextech">
							<p>
								<span class="title">Hextech Kog'Maw</span><br>
								<span class="text">A newer Hextech innovation, Kog'Maw constructs are available as pets for wealthy families, delighting Piltover's upper crust with their friendly demeanor and intricately complex design. Though living things, they are viewed among the well-to-do as little more than status symbols.</span>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="image-inner__item image-inner--13">
							<img src="assets/images/lol/nocturne-08.png" alt="nocturne-hextech">
							<p>
								<span class="title">Hextech Nocturne</span><br>
								<span class="text">Not every part of the Hextech renaissance led to bright innovations. A clandestine experiment to fuse Hextech with demonic energies wrought a living nightmare, a predator rumored to stalk the streets and back alleyways of the city. Authorities report that any such creation would have been terminated along with any such project, and that any missing persons reports are, of course, completely unrelated.</span>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="image-inner__item image-inner--14">
							<img src="assets/images/lol/rammus-09.png" alt="rammus-hextech">
							<p>
								<span class="title">Hextech Rammus</span><br>
								<span class="text">Even the most renowned Hextech artificer must bow to the creativity and perfection of nature. After crafting each of Rammus's arcs to mimic the golden spiral, the creature proved so efficient at rolling... it escaped the moment its creator put down her wrench.</span>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="image-inner__item image-inner--15">
							<img src="assets/images/lol/renekton-10.png" alt="renekton-hextech">
							<p>
								<span class="title">Hextech Renekton</span><br>
								<span class="text">As is so often the way, artificers of the Hextech Renaissance pushed too far and too fast into their new science, without fully considering the possible consequences. Renekton—a half-mad monster of flesh and metal—is the result of that shortsightedness.</span>
