Finally seeing the truth, she rejects the Cosmic Court, instead serving her own dark ambition to quiet the banal noise of creation. For she now knows her true fate—to reign as Queen of a Dark Court, and rightful master of the Dark Star.</span>

Though he still bears his Cosmic armor, the mind and figure within has been twisted and reforged to know only hatred and destruction.</span>
